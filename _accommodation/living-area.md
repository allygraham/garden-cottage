title: Living Area
content: <p>The kitchen comes complete with a SMEG range cooker, microwave, large fridge-freezer, washing machine, dishwasher and all the crockery and cutlery you're ever likely to need. To the side, a large dining table comfortably seats eight.</p>
<p>Besides this is a cosy TV area with a large corner sofa by the fire and multi-channel TV and DVD player. In the dresser are a host of family board games, books and DVDs.</p>
<p>One of our favourite spots is the two sofas at the back of the living area. French doors flood this area with natural light.</p>
