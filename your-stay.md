  <p>At Garden Cottage you will find just about every modern convenience you could imagine as well as some you might not expect to see in a holiday home. 
    All we ask is that you treat the cottage with care so that the next guests find it in the same condition you did. And we know that spillages and breaks happen.
      Unless the damage is extensive, you will not be charged. Please just let us know what happened so we can quickly repair or replace the damaged items.
  </p>
  <p>
    Instructions for all the appliances can be found in a white folder in the shelf under the coffee table and the heating instructions are displayed above the Hive controller by the kitchen.
  </p>
  <p>
    You'll find the bins in the bin store through the black door about 20 feet to your right as you leave the cottage's front door.
  </p>
  <p>
    Well-behaved dogs are welcome, but please keep them downstairs only and not in the family bedroom. And please, please clean up any mess in the garden. The next guests may have small children and we do not want any 'accidents'.
  </p>
  <p>
    Smoking is strictly off limits inside the cottage.
  </p>
  <p>
    No parties or large gatherings without express approval.
